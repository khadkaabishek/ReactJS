Today, I took the time to revisit everything I've learned in the past 6 days. It was a great opportunity to consolidate my understanding and reflect on the amazing journey so far.
Over the past week, I started my journey with an introduction to React, focusing on its component-based architecture and core philosophy. I explored JSX syntax and learned how it integrates JavaScript seamlessly into UI development. Diving deeper, I gained a solid understanding of state management and lifecycle methods, which are essential for creating dynamic and interactive applications.
Later, I mastered React Fragments, enabling me to group multiple elements without extra DOM nodes. I also worked with array map methods to dynamically render data, learned conditional rendering to enhance interactivity, and explored passing data via props for better component communication.
Styling React components became more efficient with CSS Modules, allowing me to write maintainable and reusable styles. Additionally, I understood how to pass children components dynamically into container components for more flexible layouts. Most recently, I focused on event handling in React, including synthetic events, camelCase conventions, and implementing controlled inputs with the onChange event.
Reflecting on these concepts today has given me more clarity and confidence to move forward. Iâ€™m excited to continue this learning journey and explore more powerful features of React! ðŸš€
